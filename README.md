The goal is to analyze earthquake data and potentially be able to predict future earthquakes.  In order to accomplish this, data will be read into R and basic models and summary statistics will be generated.  In addition, different time series analysis techniques will be implemented to aid in predicting potential earthquakes.  Some of these techniques may include:

1. ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
2. Spectrum Analysis (analysis in terms of a spectrum of frequencies or related quantities)
